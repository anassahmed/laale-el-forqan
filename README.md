# What's La'ale' El-Forqan?

**La'ale' El-forqan** is a Pythonic facebook web application quiz, that shows an Aya and asks you about the Sura of this Aya.

## The Story

I invented this application in the night before Qur'an Exam, when I and my friends was revising the Qur'an for the next day Exam.

We used this way in this application to test our memorization, so I applied it in this facebook application.

You can use, test, deploy it with [Okasha](http://www.ojuba.org/wiki/okasha) by the way explained [here](http://www.ojuba.org/wiki/okasha/deployment).

You should use it in real Facebook application by replacing facebook application information in the start of *functions.py*.

You can use it without Facebook application via **Demo Mode**.

This application is available in **Arabic** Language only.

## Demo Mode

You can try Demo Mode by adding **"?demo=1"** to the application path. so you don't have to log into via your Facebook account.
